This mod allows you to quickly research all items in your inventory. It researches only the necessary number of items and does not affect already researched or favorited items.
To quickly research items, you need to press the "J" key or a button under the inventory.

Sometimes the hotkey may not be assigned and you will have to assign it manually.
This mod should also works with items that can be researched from other mods.

If you encounter any bugs, report them in the Steam page of this mod.
